# QuoteApp Architecture
## Decoupled Web Architecture
(The goal is to separate frontend development to our backend development)

### QuoteApp design architecture is decided to be de-coupled.
(Microservices in mind is ready for future approaches)

### Summary
- Semi - [Microservices](https://#).
- [TDD approach](https://#).
- FrontEnd : VUE3 cli, bootstrap
- Backend : Laravel 10 (Pure API usage, LUMEN would be considered for future projects.)

### Frontend Approach
- Using VUE3 as frontend library.
- Boostrap (Tailwind would be used maybe in future development).
- Usage of Svelte or SvelteKit in the future is highly being considered.

### Backend Approach
- Laravel is leverage as API.
- Sanctum with the auth middleware.
- Lumen would be the future approach for other backend if time would push this project to be in pure microservices.
- Python (Django or FastAPI would be use in our dashboard).

QuoteApp docs will be available as soon as it is working online.
